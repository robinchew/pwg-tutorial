Quick install guide
===================

Before you can use Django, you'll need to get it installed.

Install Python on Windows
=========================

Download and install https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/python-3.6.0-amd64.exe

.. admonition:: Be careful during installation!

    One thing to watch out for: Make sure you tick the "Add Python 3.6 to PATH" checkbox before installing, as shown below. If not, you will not be able to run ``python`` in your shell.

Launch Shell on Windows
=======================

Go to Start menu and search for ``cmd`` and open the command prompt/shell.

You can verify that Python is installed by typing ``python`` from your shell;
you should see something like::

    C:\Users\alex>python
    Python 3.6.x
    [GCC 4.x] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>

Press ``Ctrl + D`` to exit.

Install Python on Mac
=====================

Open Terminal (Command+Space, type Terminal and press Enter)

Enter ``xcode-select --install`` and complete installation

Next copy paste the following and press enter:

``/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"``

Then:

``brew install python3``

And finally

``pip3 install django``

From now on, when this guide tells you to type `python` in the terminal, type `python3` instead.
Likewise, `pip` should be replaced with `pip3`

Other Installers

Set up a database
=================

Python includes a lightweight database called SQLite so you won't need to set up a database.

Install Django
==============

::

    C:\Users\alex\>pip install django

Is Django installed?
====================

To verify that Django can be seen by Python, type ``python`` from your shell.
Then at the Python prompt, try to import Django:

.. parsed-literal::

    >>> import django
    >>> print(django.get_version())
    |version|

You may have another version of Django installed.

Text Editor/IDEs
================

Text editors just make changing text easier while IDEs (Interactive Development Environment) goes beyond just writing code, like the ability to automatically run code and interactively stepping through each line of code to fix bugs. Sometimes the line between text editors and IDEs are blurred.

Python can be coded on the most barebones of text editors. There are many text editors and IDEs out there that you can explore.

To keep things quick and simple, we will recommend:

* Sublime Text 3
    * `Windows 64bit <https://download.sublimetext.com/Sublime%20Text%20Build%203126%20x64%20Setup.exe>`_
    * `Mac OSX 10.7 or later <https://download.sublimetext.com/Sublime%20Text%20Build%203126.dmg>`_
    * `Others <https://www.sublimetext.com/3>`_

Other text editors:

* Notepad++ (notepad-plus-plus.org)
* Atom (atom.io)

Other IDEs:

* PyCharm (www.jetbrains.com/pycharm)
* Visual Studio Code (code.visualstudio.com)


You are now ready to code!
